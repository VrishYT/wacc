# Functions should be able to have the same name as variables
# variable can be reassigned without affecting the function

# Output:
# hello
# 6
# bye
#
# Program:

begin
    int inc(int x) is
        return x + 1
    end
    string inc = "hello";
    println inc ;
    inc = "bye" ;
    int tmp = call inc(5);
    println tmp ;
    println inc
end
